Elad Walach, Michael Braginsky, Guy Reiner set out to create a decentralized virtual doctor in 2016 which marked the start of a company called Aidoc. By December of that year, the Aidoc project had launched which confirmed product viability. The company raised $7M in initially lead by TLV Partners and then raised another $27M led by Square Peg Capital after that. Eventually, in their series C, they were able to raise $66M.

Aidoc develops computer-aided simple triage and notification systems in order to assist doctors in diagnoses and improve patient outcomes. Aidoc’s target markets include health networks, hospitals and radiology groups worldwide. To give an estimate of approximate customers, there are 165,000 hospitals world wide and 7100 radiology clinics. Aidoc is often described as a “pioneer” in the medical AI space. Utilizing its proprietary aiOS™, it has developed the first true end-to-end Ai platform for healthcare setting it apart by being one of the first and having its own unique proprietary technology which equips them to analyze and consolidate medical data to manage unforeseen circumstances.
	
Aidoc is focusing on applying AI in the medical field which is just one of the major technology trends in the medical field in recent years (others include Telemedicine, Healthcare wearables/IoT devices, and Block Chain). With the rapid acceleration in technology, Aidoc is not the only company operating in the space. Major companies including Siemens Healthineers, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft are all already operating in and disrupting the industry. Aidoc has addressed workload challenges and improved workflow processes by improving turnaround time and improving time on patient visits. Specifically, Aidoc has produced 72% more activations/referrals, 55% reduction in turnaround time, 26% reduction in length of stay, $400k annual cost savings at 13 sites.
	
If I was to advise the company, I would recommend they offer ai medical scribes. This is something that could be an application for Microsoft’s CoPilot. I believe that this, if nothing else, would be an opportunity to show providers how AI can be of assistance in the field in general. Something simple and less critical would be a good way to get their foot in the door at new customer locations. By using NLP and speech recognition, it would be able to provide this service by translating language into text.
